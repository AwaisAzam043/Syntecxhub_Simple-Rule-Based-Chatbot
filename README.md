# Syntecxhub_Simple-Rule-Based-Chatbot
The Simple Rule-Based Chatbot is a conversational AI system built using pattern matching and predefined rules instead of machine learning. The chatbot identifies user intents such as greetings, help requests, and small talk using keyword patterns and responds with appropriate predefined messages. It also includes a small knowledge base that allows the bot to answer domain-specific questions.

The system supports interactive conversation through a console interface or web-based GUI and maintains a log of conversation history for analysis. This project demonstrates the fundamentals of Natural Language Processing, intent recognition, and human-computer interaction using deterministic logic.
